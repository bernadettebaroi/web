 <h2> MY HABITS </h2>
               <p> Even since i was little, i would always fix any tilted pictures or dust 
               the desk. I never realized i had a thing for organizing untill many people 
               began saying i was good organizer. I began taking a liking to organizng. It 
               became like a habit at this point.

<h2> MY CONCERN </h2> 
               <p> I tend to get very stressed over little thing that are unorganized. I 
               feel like i need to fix it before anything. But whenever i'm somewhere new
               i tend to fix little things here and there.

<h2> MY CONCLUSION </h2>
               <p> I dont think being organized is a bad thing but it can get very 
               intense sometime. I love when i mmet people who are also organized. 
               Once in a while i tend to be unorganized myself, so it's not a constant 
               thing i do.
